# Welcome to Abui

Abui is a custom UI component registry built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). It provides a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable React components that you can copy and paste into your projects.

## Features

- 🎨 **Beautifully Designed** — All components are thoughtfully designed and follow modern design principles
- 🚀 **Copy & Paste** — No complicated setup. Just copy the code and customize it to your needs
- ♿ **Accessible** — Built with accessibility in mind using Radix UI primitives
- 🎯 **TypeScript Ready** — Full TypeScript support out of the box
- 🌙 **Dark Mode** — All components support dark mode
- 📦 **Registry System** — Easy installation via the shadcn CLI

## Getting Started

To use components from the Abui registry, first configure your `components.json`:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@abui": "https://abui.antoniobrandao.com/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

Then install components using:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @abui/button
```

## Philosophy

Abui follows the same philosophy as shadcn/ui:

1. **Copy and paste, not npm install** — The code is yours to customize
2. **Accessible by default** — Built on top of Radix UI
3. **Open source** — Use it however you want
4. **Customizable** — Tailor the components to match your design system
